A while ago, we discussed the concepts of fabula and discourse, which belong to the Structuralist subset of Narratology. Fabula is defined as the events as they happened. The reader often has to construct these events in their entirety in their head because no story can tell you everything last detail in every event that took place. Bonnycastle writes, “a novel cannot give a complete account of anything. Any narrative condenses most events greatly, skips long periods completely, and often provides only one character’s view of what is happening” (162). A novel is not fabula it is discourse, which is defined as how these events are presented through language on the written page. Discourse accounts for all the decisions the storyteller makes when deciding how to tell the story.

These two concepts are similar to two concepts in films. In films, fabula is replaced with the term “Story” which is what is told, the things that happened in the film. “Plot”, however, is how the story was told. The way in which a story can be told differs because of the use of particular temporal and spatial patterns or the utilization of mise-en-scene, cinematography, editing, and sound. Like narratology asserts, this contrast between “Story” and “Plot” means that two filmmakers can get the same events to film but they still won’t make the exact same films.
