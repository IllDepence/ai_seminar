- welcome
- name
- title (story telling -> generating narratives by means of planning)

2-3
- can find application areas where the problem at hand is stucturally similar to classic problem solving taks
- in the case of stories: think of story as sequence of character actions
- story -> look at it as a sequence of character actions ... you already have a story. benefit? when sth new (i.e. when creating new stories)

4
- outline
- how to model story worlds as planning problems
- differences to classical planning
- look at two concrete approaches. designated by the words "Fabula" and "Discourse" (explanation later)
- end: conclusion

5
- on a basic level you can think of it like this

6-8
- for example, this very short story

9
10-11
- so, this was on a basic level, if we want to approach the problem with more sophistication
- the following aspects can be considered

12
- we have story variations: given a rough outline of a story, create different variants
- interactivity: a story character is controlled by a human, the rest of the system has to "react"
- story structures: given a set of characters, abilities, ...
- all covered in approaches, but before that

13
- as we have seen, similar
- but different in nature
    - purpose: problem solving task, to solve; story to entertain
    - key properties [of solutions]: be short, find fast / <hard to grasp> ... interestingness (how to formalize?)
- specialized planners BUT ALSO much can be modeled into classic planning task
- interactivity not so much intrinsic difference but interesting aspect

14
- 2 concrete approaches
- Haslum ... planning a fabula
- Porteous ... planning a discourse
- as stated before, approach on different levels, explanation:

- for illustration purposes, imagine a low budget movie where a large battle starts ... and then you only see the aftermath
