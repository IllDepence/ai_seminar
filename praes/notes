- welcome
- name
- title (story telling -> generating narratives by means of planning)

2-3
- can find application areas where the problem at hand is stucturally similar to classic problem solving taks
- in the case of stories: think of story as sequence of character actions
- story -> look at it as a sequence of character actions ... you already have a story. benefit? when sth new (i.e. when creating new stories)

4
- outline
- how to model story worlds as planning problems
- differences to classical planning
- look at two concrete approaches. designated by the words "Fabula" and "Discourse" (explanation later)
- end: conclusion

5
- on a basic level you can think of it like this

6-8
- for example, this very short story

9
10-11
- so, this was on a basic level, if we want to approach the problem with more sophistication
- the following aspects can be considered

12
- we have story variations: given a rough outline of a story, create different variants
- interactivity: a story character is controlled by a human, the rest of the system has to "react"
- story structures: given a set of characters, abilities, ...
- all covered in approaches, but before that

13
- as we have seen, similar
- but different in nature
    - purpose: problem solving task, to solve; story to entertain
    - key properties [of solutions]: be short, find fast / <hard to grasp> ... interestingness (how to formalize?)
- specialized planners BUT ALSO much can be modeled into classic planning task
- interactivity not so much intrinsic difference but interesting aspect

14
- 2 concrete approaches
- Haslum ... planning a fabula
- Porteous ... planning a discourse
- as stated before, approach on different levels, explanation:

15
- <quote>
- for illustration purposes, imagine a low budget movie where a large battle starts ... and then you only see the aftermath

16
- start with fabula, story structure
    -> since story structure **we start out w/ set of characters + world rules**
- based on approach for IPOCL planner, Haslum shows in paper how the aspects considered in approach can be modeled as classic planning problem
- in order to create a believable story: focus on intentionality, which entails
    - character goals
    - delegation of goals
    -> used to form intetional plans

17-19
- to illustrate, set of characters, e.g. king, princess, knight; given goal; solve
- character goals: princess marry, knight slay dragon
- delegation: king commanded knight to slay dragon

20-21
- how is this formalized to realize to notion of intentional plans?
- number of steps S, a subset of which are intentional actions (**S' -> frame of commitment**), associated with literal (intends A g)
- to illustrate
- to give an idea of how a result looks like ...

22-27
- paper uses story close to Aladdin and magic lamp (but adds dragon)
- whole thing too much to explan, therefore just frames of commitment explained before
    - Jafar wants to marry Jasmine
    - Aladdin wants to slay a dragon (delegated)
    - Genie intends to make Jasmine fall in love w/ Jafar
    - Aladdin intends to slay the Genie
    - Jasmine intends to marry Jafar

28
- the other approach tries to achieve 2 goals: create story variations (rough outline given) and be able to support interavtivity
- for that, 2 tools are eployed:
    - modelling character PoV -> variation
    - Decomposition of the planning problem-> variation & interactivity

29
- we start w/ PoV
- encompasses 2 aspects: perspective (from which characters eye), disposition (a characters feelings/thoughts towards a specific matter)
- earlier action of Viserys selling Daeneris

30
- two possible perspectives
- for each perspective, two different dispositions

31
- for each of these 4, a dedicated version of the operator has to be defined
- pov is precondition, other things such as effects may vary (e.g. revengeful Daeneris hating her brother)

32
- this was PoV
- decomposition of the planning problem is a process added to the story world modelling process
- results in process like this ...

33
- right hand side is what we did in the beginning
- for left hand side: identify key components of plot structure, formulate constraints
- use to decompose such that constraints are 'inbetween goals' / checkpoints
- how does this help?
    - variation: only select a subset of constraints
    - interactivity: faster replanning after human intervention
- again, to give an idea of how a result looks like ...

34
- shakespear's merchant of venice
- perspective of a character called antonio, etc.

35
- conclude
